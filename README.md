###Release v 4.9.1.0

Date: 2016-11-02

Added a more reliable way of detecting the build date of Terminals.exe (The 'AssemblyTimeStampAttribute' attribute has been implemented in the namespace 'Kohl.Framework.Info')

Internal stuff: Converted the build system to an ubuntu build system (CircleCI)

Added missing DLLs to the Terminals' setup file.

Improved sed switch for differentiating between Terminals.zip (AppDir\Logs\Terminals.log) and Terminals.exe (AppData\...\Terminals.log) <- Check the log4net switch for setup.exe -> 'sed' replace seems to be not working -> DONE - works again now

Now the user can actively choose if he or she desires to use either the Credentials.xml file or a KeePass database as the default credential store.

Removed obsolete localization which went back to the time of .NET 1.0.

Reduced the logging complexity

Added output to .gitignore

Removed obsolete files not any longer required

```

Plugin settings and option will now only be written to configuration file if the value differs from the default value.
Settings or favorites like

All rights for the original code belong to [Rob Chartier](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/RobChartier) and his colleagues ([about 8 people in total](https://terminals.codeplex.com/team/view)).

The code itself differs completely from the original version, nearly no parts except 3rd party libraries are in it's orignal condition. I attempted to improve the code, fixed a lot of bugs and added a lot of features.
